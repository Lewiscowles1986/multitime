================================================================================

Unix's 'time' utility is a simple and often effective way of measuring how
long a command takes to run. Unfortunately, running a command once can give
misleading timings: the process may create a cache on its first execution,
running faster subsequently; other processes may cause the command to be
starved of CPU or IO time; etc. It is common to see people run 'time' several
times and take whichever values they feel most comfortable with. Inevitably,
this causes problems.

multitime is, in essence, a simple extension to time whch runs a command
multiple times and prints the timing mins, maxes, means (averages), medians,
and standard deviations having done so. This can give a much better
understanding of the command's performance.
